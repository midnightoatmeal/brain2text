Brain-to-Text AI is a Neuralink-inspired brain-computer interface that translates human brain activity into text using EEG (electroencephalography) signals. The project demonstrates how deep learning can be applied to noisy neural data, transforming raw brainwave activity into meaningful words and sentences.
